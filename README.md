====

cuwo is an open server implementation for Cube World, and includes various
utilities to manipulate its data.

Running
=======

See the [quick-start guide](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki) for a 
quick way to get started.

Status
======

Right now, cuwo has a server that can serve clients. Players can see each other
in the game, but a lot still needs to be done. There is a basic scripting
system in place, which allows for chat commands, etc.

There is also a working MITM server that can inject packets. It's useful for
reverse-engineering the protocol and can be used as an alternative to a
standalone server.

There is also a working Cube World/Qubicle model converter. Find it in the 
'tools' folder.
